# RabbitMQ Memory Configuration Guide

## Memory Watermark Configuration

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Memory_Management
        Total[Total System Memory]
        High[High Watermark<br>70% of RAM]
        Paging[Paging Threshold<br>75% of High Watermark]
        
        Total --> High
        High --> Paging
    end
```

### 1. High Watermark Setting
```ini
vm_memory_high_watermark.relative = 0.7
```

This setting means:
- RabbitMQ will use up to 70% of available system memory
- When memory usage reaches 70%, RabbitMQ starts blocking publishers
- Protects the system from running out of memory

#### Example Calculation
```plaintext
System Memory: 16GB
High Watermark: 16GB Ã— 0.7 = 11.2GB
```

```mermaid
pie title Memory Distribution with 0.7 Watermark
    "Available for RabbitMQ" : 70
    "Reserved for System" : 30
```

### 2. Paging Ratio Setting
```ini
vm_memory_high_watermark_paging_ratio = 0.75
```

This setting means:
- Paging begins at 75% of the high watermark
- Example: If high watermark is 11.2GB, paging starts at 8.4GB
- Messages are moved to disk to free up memory

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Memory_Thresholds
        direction TB
        
        A[Normal Operation<br><8.4GB]
        B[Paging Zone<br>8.4GB - 11.2GB]
        C[Blocking Zone<br>>11.2GB]
        
        A --> B
        B --> C
        
        style A fill:#90EE90
        style B fill:#FFD700
        style C fill:#FF6347
    end
```

## Memory States and Actions

### 1. Normal Operation (<75% of Watermark)
- All messages handled in memory
- Optimal performance
- No paging or blocking

### 2. Paging State (75% - 100% of Watermark)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Memory Usage
    participant R as RabbitMQ
    participant D as Disk
    
    M->>R: Reaches 75% of Watermark
    R->>D: Start paging messages
    D->>R: Acknowledge paging
    R->>M: Memory freed
```

### 3. Blocking State (>100% of Watermark)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Publisher
    participant R as RabbitMQ
    participant C as Consumer
    
    P->>R: Attempt to publish
    R-->>P: Block publishing
    C->>R: Continue consuming
    R->>M: Memory decreases
    M->>R: Below watermark
    R->>P: Resume publishing
```

## Configuration Examples

### 1. High-Memory System (64GB RAM)
```ini
# For systems with large memory
vm_memory_high_watermark.relative = 0.8
vm_memory_high_watermark_paging_ratio = 0.75
```

### 2. Low-Memory System (4GB RAM)
```ini
# For systems with limited memory
vm_memory_high_watermark.relative = 0.5
vm_memory_high_watermark_paging_ratio = 0.8
```

### 3. Absolute Value Setting
```ini
# Alternative: Set exact memory limit
vm_memory_high_watermark.absolute = 4GB
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Monitoring_Points
        M1[Memory Usage]
        M2[Paging Rate]
        M3[Blocking Events]
    end
    
    subgraph Actions
        A1[Log Alert]
        A2[Admin Notification]
        A3[Scale Resources]
    end
    
    M1 --> A1
    M2 --> A2
    M3 --> A3
```

### Memory Usage Commands
```bash
# Check current memory usage
rabbitmqctl status | grep memory

# Monitor memory alarms
rabbitmqctl list_alarm

# Detailed memory breakdown
rabbitmqctl eval 'rabbit_vm:memory().'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Memory Sizing**
   - Monitor actual usage patterns
   - Account for peak loads
   - Leave headroom for system operations

2. **Tuning Guidelines**
   ```ini
   # Production settings
   vm_memory_high_watermark.relative = 0.7    # Standard setting
   vm_memory_high_watermark_paging_ratio = 0.75 # Balance between performance and safety
   ```

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Set up alerts before reaching watermark
   - Monitor paging frequency
   - Track blocking events

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Frequent Blocking**
```mermaid
graph TB
    Problem[Frequent Blocking] --> Check1[Check Memory Usage]
    Check1 --> Action1[Increase Memory]
    Check1 --> Action2[Adjust Watermark]
    Check1 --> Action3[Optimize Queues]
```

2. **High Paging Rate**
```mermaid
graph TB
    Problem[High Paging Rate] --> Check1[Monitor Queue Size]
    Check1 --> Action1[Increase Consumers]
    Check1 --> Action2[Optimize Message Size]
    Check1 --> Action3[Adjust Paging Ratio]
```

### Recovery Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
```bash
# Clear problematic queues
rabbitmqctl purge_queue queue_name

# Force garbage collection
rabbitmqctl eval 'garbage_collect().'
```

2. **Long-term Solutions**
   - Implement message TTL
   - Use lazy queues for large messages
   - Implement back pressure mechanisms

## Performance Impact

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Performance_Factors
        M[Memory Usage]
        P[Paging Activity]
        T[Throughput]
    end
    
    M --> T
    P --> T
```

### Impact Levels
1. **Normal Operation** (<75% watermark)
   - Optimal performance
   - No paging overhead
   - Maximum throughput

2. **Paging Zone** (75-100% watermark)
   - Slightly reduced performance
   - Some disk I/O overhead
   - Maintained throughput

3. **Blocking Zone** (>100% watermark)
   - Reduced publisher throughput
   - Increased latency
   - Potential message backlog
